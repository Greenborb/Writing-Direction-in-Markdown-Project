Golf is a sport that doesn't so much focus on raw strength and pure physical prowess so much as patience and mental focus. But, getting started always means learning the most essential bit to playing golf: how to swing your golf club. 

## What You Need

- A Golf Club 
> For the typical swing, it is suggested to
> start with a long distance club, such as
> an iron or a driver.
- A Golf Ball
- A Tee (If You're Using a Driver)

## The Set-Up

1. Put both feet about shoulder width apart. If you have a golf ball in front of you, the ball should be lined up with the middle of your stance.
2. Grip the club firmly but loosely with both hands; have your non dominant hand grip first with the thumb on the top, then your dominant hand on top of the non-dominant hand's thumb in the same sort of grip.
> Avoid gripping the club too tightly or too loosely.
3. Hold the club in front of you so that the bottom of the club head is flat on the ground and is lined up with the middle of your feet.
4. Bend your back until the top of the grip is roughly one fist length away from the inside of your thigh, and the face of the club has the middle lined up with the ball. Lightly bend your knees.
> Your arms should form something like a triangle where you grip the club
> Don't bend over too far!

## The Swing

1. Make sure your stance is correct. Keep your eyes fixed on the back of the ball.
2. In a pendulum-like motion, swing the club back behind you. The club shouldn't be hanging over behind your back or shoulder, but be held upward, with one arm pointing straight out behind you and the other bent like an L.
> Envision that there is a flat plane of glass that lines up with the ball and your neck. You want your club to swing along the surface of the imaginary plane.
3. Begin your downswing, rotating your body and allowing the club to make contact with the ball. Keep your eyes on where the ball is as you swing.
4. Let the club head travel straight ahead before letting it curve back around. The shoulder that was pointing to behind you should now be under your chin.
5. Allow your head to look up, with the club now behind your head. 
> Hold the pose.
